For now, it's available in two modes:

1) *predict*.
basic usage example
```python kuppnet.py predict path/to/fasta/file```
2) *eval*.
basic usage example
```python kuppnet.py eval path/to/fasta/file --input_cls path/to/true/classes```
where the `path/to/true/classes` is a path to tsv-like file with
id--true_positive_class_position pairs.

For prediction one of 3 models are used, trained on separate data sets.
Default model is model â„–3.

Article with description of models' architectures and data sets is
submitted.

More information about main script usage can be obtained using
`python3 kuppnet.py --help` command.
